# React.js and Spring Data REST
REFERENCE: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/ & https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#reference

- Domain 'Object'
Domain objects form the cornerstone of any Spring Data REST-based application
```
(1) @Entity is a JPA annotation that denotes the whole class for storage in a relational table.
(2) @Id and @GeneratedValue are JPA annotations to note the primary key and that is generated automatically when needed.
```

- Repository 
```
(1) The repository extends Spring Data Commons' CrudRepository and plugs in the type of the domain object and its primary key
```

- Loaders
To work with this application, we need to pre-load it with some data
```
(1) - @Component - This class is marked with Spring’s @Component annotation so that it is automatically picked up by @SpringBootApplication
(2) - CommandLineRunner - It implements Spring Boot’s CommandLineRunner so that it gets run after all the beans are created and registered
(3) - @Autowired - It uses constructor injection and autowiring to get Spring Data’s automatically created EmployeeRepository
(4) - The run() method is invoked with command line arguments, loading up your data

One of the biggest, most powerful features of Spring Data is its ability to write JPA queries for you.
Spring Data looks at the name of methods in a repository class and figures out the operations you need, including saving, deleting, and finding.

- Controller
Setting up 'C' in MVC
```
(1) - @Controller - marks this class as a Spring MVC controller.
(2) - @RequestMapping - flags the index() method to support the / route.
(3) - It returns index as the name of the template, which Spring Boot’s autoconfigured view resolver will map to src/main/resources/templates/index.html
```

- HTML template 
Thymeleaf

- App Component
```
React.Component{…​} - is the method that creates a React component.
componentDidMount - is the API invoked after React renders a component in the DOM.
render - is the API that “draws” the component on the screen.
