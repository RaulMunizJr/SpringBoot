@JsonCreator: Signals how Jackson can create an instance of this POJO.
@JsonProperty: Marks the field into which Jackson should put this constructor argument.

- Controller
HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are identified by the @RestController annotation, which combines the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations.

- @RequestMapping: annotation ensures that HTTP requests to /greeting are mapped to the greeting() method.
@RequestParam binds the value of the query string parameter name into the name parameter of the greeting() method.

- Both linkTo(…) and methodOn(…) are static methods on ControllerLinkBuilder that let you fake a method invocation on the controller.
The returned LinkBuilder will have inspected the controller method’s mapping annotation to build up exactly the URI to which the method is mapped.

- @RestController
Because the @RestController annotation is present on the class, an implicit @ResponseBody annotation is added to the greeting method. This causes Spring MVC to render the returned HttpEntity and its payload (the Greeting) directly to the response.

- The call to withSelfRel() creates a Link instance that you add to the Greeting representation model.
