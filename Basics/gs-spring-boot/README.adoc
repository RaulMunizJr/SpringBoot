# Building an Application with Spring Boot
REFERENCE: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/
- @RestController
Ready for use by Spring MVC to handle web requests

> src/main/java/com/example/springboot/HelloController.java

- @RequestMapping
maps / to the index() method.
@RestController combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, two annotations that results in web requests returning data rather than a view.

@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
- @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
- @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.
There is also a CommandLineRunner method marked as a @Bean, and this runs on start up. It retrieves all the beans that were created by your application or that were automatically added by Spring Boot. It sorts them and prints them out.

- Unit Tests
MockMvc comes from Spring Test and lets you, through a set of convenient builder classes, send HTTP requests into the DispatcherServlet and make assertions about the result. Note the use of @AutoConfigureMockMvc and @SpringBootTest to inject a MockMvc instance

### Production-grade Services
- You can check the health of the application: 'localhost:8080/actuator/health'
```
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator' -> in gradle file
The actuator exposes the following:
~errors
~actuator/health
~actuator/info
~actuator
```
