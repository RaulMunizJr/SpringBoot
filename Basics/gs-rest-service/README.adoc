# Building a RESTful Web Service
REFERENCE: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
- Bean
Provide a plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the id and content data
> src/main/java/com/example/restservice/Greeting.java

- Controller
HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are identified by the @RestController annotation

> src/main/java/com/example/restservice/GreetingController.java
```
- The @GetMapping annotation ensures that HTTP GET requests to /greeting are mapped to the greeting() method.
- There are companion annotations for other HTTP verbs (e.g. @PostMapping for POST). There is also a @RequestMapping annotation that they all derive from, and can serve as a synonym (e.g. @RequestMapping(method=GET)).
- @RequestParam binds the value of the query string parameter name into the name parameter of the greeting() method. If the name parameter is absent in the request, the defaultValue of World is used.
- The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new Greeting object with id and content attributes based on the next value from the counter and formats the given name by using the greeting template
```
- @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

> @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

> @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet

> @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers
